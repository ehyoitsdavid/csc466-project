        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> WebRTC Performance Under Various Network Conditions</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To improve the existing WebRTC network in rural areas and remote regions.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> The approach includes WebRTC traffic analysis using Web Developer tools and Wireshark as well as Network Conditioner software to simulate various network conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong> An enhanced WebRTC protocol prototype capable of error-recovery and low lantency communication even in non-ideal conditions such as mountainous regions and slow Internet connections.</p>
